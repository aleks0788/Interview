VA
**************************************************************
Extensive feedback after which we can conclude that Olexander is to junior for VA and was not successful on this occasion.

- how to develop a page to be Experience editor friendly
- what kind of an impact front end can have on the actual development,
- doesn't know how the indexes work in sitecore, took a bit of time to get there even though he says he worked with Solr, he doesnt know which indexes go where
- doesn't have experience with Sitecore marketing
- doesn't have an experience with WFFM
- the general architecture of Sitecore he doesn't fully understand
- doesn't know how the data gets into Analytics

Architecture wise he knows really the basic of the basics. 
He used TDS, might know to find his way around. 
He is not certified. 
He mentioned that he would like to be part of the user groups but that the Polish one is bad, when I told him that I was a speaker there then
he said that it is bad in his city because there isn't one.
We talked a bit about his projects, overall, he would need a guidance.
Also, he has never installed or configured Sitecore on any other environment except his local machine.
